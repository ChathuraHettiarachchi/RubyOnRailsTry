<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>When I was 22, I joined with the IT industry as a permenently employee.</p>
<p>While I learn and started application development, I thought about quitting when challenges are high more than approximately 100 times. But with some good advices and self lernings, I kept going. I’m that person. Once I say I’ll do something, it will happen.</p>
<p>Now, I put that perseverance to work as a software engineer for Fidenz Technologies. Sometime I do find big challenges, but I breake them and fix them.</p>
<br>
<p>I’m well-versed in negotiations, planning and development, relationship management, operation management, team management and a good programmer.</p>
<p>I'm having a PGD and a BSc. Planing to continue MSc in 2019.</p>
